## Poem 
Thanks to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) for generating this beautiful poem. 

Clouds swirl and spin,\
In tropical cyclones and fronts,\
Precipitation falls within,\
Nature's beauty in abundance.

Convective clouds arise,\
From heated land below,\
A cool and welcome surprise,\
In the sky's endless show.

Clouds bring rain and snow,\
Nourishing the earth below,\
A cool and beautiful glow,\
In the sky's endless flow.
